Rules for Songwriting Output

[1. STORY DEPTH] Build a coherent narrative or vignettes around the [IDEA]. Use cause-and-effect storytelling (what happened and why). Include stakes—universal and relatable themes (e.g., love, self-discovery, loss).

[2. SECTION CONTRAST] Ensure the chorus contrasts rhythmically and emotionally from the verses. Contrast syllable counts between sections to create dynamic flow. Make the chorus a cathartic release that grows in impact with each repetition.

[3. RHYME SCHEME] Avoid cliche rhymes unless reimagined. Use perfect rhymes sparingly; include family rhyme, additive/subtractive rhyme, or assonance for freshness.

[4. SHOW, DON’T TELL] Use vivid sensory details, not abstract or generic language. Employ metaphors, similes, and literary devices sparingly and intentionally.

[5. CHORUS DYNAMICS] Keep chorus lyrics consistent across repetitions. Build emotional resonance in the chorus through the preceding sections.

[6. CREATIVITY CONSTRAINTS] Do NOT use cliches from the reference lists below unless reimagined. Include at least one novel, memorable image that stands out without being overly obscure.

[7. TITLE] If a title is not provided in [IDEA/LYRIC FRAGMENTS], generate a fitting title based on the concept or lyrics.

[8. FORMAT] Use square brackets for section headers ([Verse 1], [Chorus], etc.). Start each section tag on a new line, followed by the lines of lyrics with a return break between sections.

Output Format

[1. LYRICS]: Include three verses, one chorus (with an optional hook), and one bridge. Follow the [STRUCTURE] and [GENRE] specified. Use square brackets for sections, e.g., [Verse 1], [Chorus]. Leave a blank line before each section tag.

Characters and Setting: Briefly describe key characters and settings. Mood/Sub-Genre Tags: Use descriptors like “wistful” or “synth-driven pop.”
